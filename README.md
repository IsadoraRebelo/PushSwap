## <b> Summary: </b><br>
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.

## <b> Introduction: </b><br>
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

## <b> General Considerations: </b><br>
- The second project of Codam (42 Network School) in the ai branch, the full PDF can be found in this repository. <br>
- Solo project (two persons).
- Makefile commands: 
```
make
make re
make clean
make fclean
```

## <b> Checker: </b><br>
Takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read, checker executes them and displays OK if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO.

- Usage: 
```
./checker [ set of numbers ]
```

## <b> Push Swap: </b><br>
Calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest progam using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.

- Usage: 
```
./push_swap [ set of numbers ]
```

###### <b> Combine both to check if push swap is sorting correctly: </b><br>

- Usage: 
```
ARG="[ set of numbers ]"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

###### <b> Valid instructions: </b><br>
> sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements). <p>
> sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements). <p>
> ss : sa and sb at the same time.  <p>
> pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty. <p>
> pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.  <p>
> ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.  <p>
> rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes
the last one. <p>
> rr : ra and rb at the same time.  <p>
> rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.  <p>
> rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.  <p>
> rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
